      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        In Spain, the dish goes by a few different names, including tortilla de
        patatas, tortilla española, or tortilla de papas. (The American
        translation is a Spanish Omelette.) It’s an egg and potato dish that’s
        cooked in a skillet and served as a tapa, a main dish with a baguette
        and green salad, or even enjoyed as a snack. It tastes great served
        warm, cold, or at room temperature.

      <ul>
        <li>400ml olive oil</li>
        <li>2-3 large potatoes</li>
        <li>1 onion, peeled and halved</li>
        <li>8 eggs</li>
        <li>salt</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Thinly slice the potato halves, cut side down, so that you end up with
          half-circle shaped slices. Do the same with the onion.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Pour the olive oil into a deep frying pan and add the thinly sliced
          onion. Place over a high heat so you are cooking the onion from cold.
          Once the onion starts to sizzle (this should take about 5 minutes),
          add the sliced potatoes. Cook for about 15 minutes, stirring from time
          to time, until they are soft and cooked throughout. The potatoes and
          onions should have browned in some corners because of the contact with
          the bottom of the pan. If this hasn’t happened drain away some of the
          oil and caramelize them a bit in the pan. Remove the potatoes and
          onions from the pan and set aside.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Break the eggs into a large bowl but don’t whisk them; check there are
          no pieces of shell. Add the hot potatoes and onions to the eggs and
          season with salt while the potatoes are sitting on the top. Carefully
          mix through; use a fork to break up the eggs but don’t over-mix –
          justcan, leave the mixture to rest for half an hour to allow the
          flavours to develop.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          To make the tortilla place a non-stick pan over a medium heat and add
          a drizzle of olive oil. When the pan is hot add the egg mixture. If
          you don’t have a non-stick pan add the mixture to a very hot pan but
          reduce the heat to its lowest setting straight away; this will stop
          the tortilla sticking to the pan. Do not stir the contents of the pan!
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Depending on the depth of your pan and the amount of heat from your
          stove, the cooking time will vary so you will need to use your
          judgement. After about 3 minutes you should be able to ease the
          tortilla from the edge of the pan using a fork or spatula. At this
          point, cover the pan with a plate (which should obviously be wider
          than the pan). Hold firmly with both hands and flip the pan over on to
          the plate. Slide the tortilla back into the pan for the other side to
          cook. Place back on the heat for another 2 minutes (I like it when the
          middle is still soft and a little runny).
