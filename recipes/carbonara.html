      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Pasta carbonara is one of those simple dinners we should all know how to
        make. It’s the perfect go-to for a busy weeknight, and it’s also a dish
        fit for the weekend or even to serve to guests. Pasta carbonara
        typically features a creamy sauce that’s made with pancetta, garlic,
        pasta water, cheese and eggs. The egg-based sauce is cooked by combining
        it with the piping hot spaghetti pasta and a little of the cooking
        water.

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely
          grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little
          freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the
          water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for
          10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked)
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to
          bruise it.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop
          50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the
          butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often,
          until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted
          its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift
          it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying
          pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan
          as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away
          yet.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back
          for sprinkling over later.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour
          in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the
          spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but
          doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons
          should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little
          salt, if needed.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or
          bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining
          cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little
          dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy
          sauciness will be revived.
